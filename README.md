### Koleżeńska Ochrona Kierowców Oraz Samochodów

## Project Description
This project is an ongoing mobile application.
The app provides each user with a unique QR code that he can display in his car.
If another user wants to contact him, for example to inform him that the 
lights of his car are still on,
he can scan the QR code and send a message directly to the car owner.
